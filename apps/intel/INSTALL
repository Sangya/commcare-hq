Steps to install this app:

1. Get source:
	
	git pull origin intel

2. Sync DB

	./manage.py syncdb

4. Changes in graph queries:
 	- ignore username 'admin'
	- ignore users with id < 1
	- added query #27 to group by clinics (will change as the model does)

	./manage.py loaddata apps/graphing/fixtures/initial_data.json

5. In local.ini, change the following (or simply cp local.ini.intel local.ini):

	- add "intel" to apps under [rapidsms]

	- add the following lines to the end of the file (the templates are all under apps/intel/templates):

		BASE_TEMPLATE=intel-layout.html
		LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = /intel
		LOGIN_TEMPLATE=intel-login.html
		LOGGEDOUT_TEMPLATE=intel-logout.html
